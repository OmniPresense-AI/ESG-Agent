Iron and steel foundries, which cast various products, typically purchase iron and steel from other entities. The industry also includes metal service centres and other metal merchant wholesalers, which distribute, import or export ferrous products. Though entities are developing alternative processes, steel production primarily relies on two primary methods: the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which uses iron ore as an input, and the electric arc furnace (EAF), which uses scrap steel.

They also provide support services such as seismic surveying, equipment rental, well cementing and well monitoring. These services commonly are provided on a contractual basis, and the customer purchases or leases the materials and equipment from the service provider. Service entities also may provide personnel or subject matter expertise as part of their scope of service. The contractual relationship between oil and gas services entities and their customers plays a significant role in determining the material impacts of their sustainability performance.

The regulatory environment governing the commercial banking industry witnessed significant changes in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and continues to evolve today.

Non-traditional products include annuities, alternative risk transfers and financial guarantees. Entities in the insurance industry also engage in proprietary investments. Insurance entities generally operate within a single segment in the industry, for example, property and casualty, although some large insurance entities have diversified operations. Similarly, entities may vary based on the level of their geographical segmentation. Whereas large entities may underwrite insurance premiums in many countries, smaller entities generally operate in a single country or jurisdiction. Insurance premiums, underwriting revenue and investment income drive industry growth, while insurance claim payments present the most significant cost and source of uncertainty for profits. Insurance entities provide products and services that enable the transfer, pooling and sharing of risk necessary for a well-functioning economy. Insurance entities, through their products, can also create a form of moral hazard, reducing incentives to improve underlying behaviour and performance, and thus contributing to sustainability-related impacts. Like other financial institutions, insurance entities face risks associated with credit and financial markets. Within the industry, regulators have identified entities that engage in non-traditional or non-insurance activities, including credit default swaps (CDS) protection and debt securities insurance, as being more vulnerable to financial market developments, and therefore more likely to amplify or contribute to systemic risk. As a result, some insurance entities may be designated as Systemically Important Financial Institutions, thus exposing them to increased regulation and oversight."

Investment banks also originate and securitise loans for infrastructure and other projects. Entities in the industry generate revenues from global markets and, therefore, are exposed to various regulatory regimes.

Furthermore, entities in the industry may operate across both regulated and deregulated power markets depending on their operational span.

Gas marketing entities are gas brokers that aggregate and deliver natural gas in quantities that meet the needs of various customers, generally through other entities' transmission and distribution lines. A relatively smaller portion of this industry is involved in propane gas distribution; therefore, this standard is focused on natural gas distribution. Both types of gas are used for heating and cooking by residential, commercial and industrial customers. In regulated markets, the utility is granted a full monopoly over the distribution and sale of natural gas. A regulator must approve the rates utilities charge to prevent the abuse of their monopoly position. In deregulated markets, distribution and marketing are separated legally, and customers have a choice of which entity from which to buy their gas. In this case, a common carrier utility is guaranteed a monopoly only over distribution and is required legally to transmit all gas equitably along its pipes for a fixed fee. Overall, entities must provide safe, reliable, low-cost gas, while effectively managing their social and environmental impacts, such as community safety and methane emissions."
